    <h2>Brother Birch</h2>
    <p>My name is Nathan Birch. I live in Rexburg and have 5 beautiful, rambunctious children. I love playing with them and spending time with my dear wife. We love board games, good movies, spending time outside, and pretty much anything else as long as we're together. :)</p>
